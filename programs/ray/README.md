# Ray Benchmark

This is an early ray tracer benchmark that was a port of a simple C
program.  The original C program was written by Don Mitchell (Bell Labs)
and was ported to SML by John Reppy. The benchmark was used as a
standard program in the SML/NJ Benchmark suite.

This version of the benchmark has signatures for some of the modules
and produces a [PPM file](https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html)
as output.
