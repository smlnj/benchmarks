# The Fannkuch Benchmark

This benchmark is a port of an OCaml solution to the [Fannkuch-redux benchmark](
https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/fannkuchredux.html)
from the *Computer Language Benchmarks Game*.

The original benchmark was described in

> [*Performing Lisp analysis of the FANNKUCH benchmark*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/382109.382124)
> ACM SIGPLAN Lisp Pointers, October 1994
