# Stream Sieve Benchmark

This benchmark computes the 20000'th prime number using the
[**Sieve of Eratosthenes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
implemented as a functional stream.

The implementation is ported from Racket and was part of the [**Gradual Typing
Benchmarks**](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/gtp-benchmarks).  The
original benchmark was written by Ben Greenman.
