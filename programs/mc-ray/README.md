# Monte Carlo Raytracing Benchmark

A SML implementation of a Monte Carlo ray tracer (aka path tracer) based
on the [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io)
books by Peter Shirley.  The SML version was written by John Reppy and
renders a 150x100 image of scene of 124 random spheres using 50 samples
per pixel.
