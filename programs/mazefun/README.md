# Mazefun Benchmark

A SML port of the [`mazefun`](http://www.larcenists.org/R7src/mazefun.scm)
rectangular-maze generator.  The original Scheme program was written by
Marc Feeley and ported to Standard ML by Kavon Farvardin as part of the
Manticore Project.  We generate a 15x15 maze 10,000 times (the original
benchmark generated a 11x11 maze).
