# Boyer Benchmark

The "Boyer" benchmark ported from the Gabriel Lisp Benchmarks.  It performs
Prolog-like rule-directed rewriting to check for tautologies.  See the paper
[*The Boyer benchmark meets linear logic*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/181889.181890)
by Henry Baker (1993) for more discussion of the benchmark program.

This program was one of the original **SML/NJ** benchmarks described in
Appel's *Compiling with Continuations*.
