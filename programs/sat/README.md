# SAT solver benchmark

This is a brute-force SAT solver ported from Scheme (see
<https://github.com/ilyasergey/reachability/blob/master/benchmarks/kcfa/sat-brute.scm>).
We have extended the size of the problem to involve ten variables (up
from the four) and added some additional clauses to increase the amount
of work.
