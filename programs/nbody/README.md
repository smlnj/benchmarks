# N-Body Benchmark

A brute-force (O(n^2)) N-body simulation run on the major planets of
the solar system.  Versions of this benchmark have been used to test
parallel systems.  This version is a port of the [*Computer Language
Benchmarks Game*](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame)
**C** program that was itself a port of a Chapel program.

This version is purely-functional and list-based.  The **MLton**
benchmark suite has an imperative version that is closer in style
to the **C** code.
