# Simple Benchmark

A spherical fluid-dynamics program written as a Fortran benchmark by Crowley *et al* at
Lawrence Livermore Labs in 1978.  It was first ported to Id by Ekanadham and Arvind,
and then to Standard ML by Lal George.

This program was one of the original **SML/NJ** benchmarks described in
Appel's *Compiling with Continuations*.
