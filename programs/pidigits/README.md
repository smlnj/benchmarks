# pidigits

This benchmark computes digits of pi using streams.  The benchmark is from the
[Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/pidigits.html) and is ported from the MLton benchmarks.

The algorithm used is described in Section 5 of [Unbounded Spigot Algorithms for the
Digits of Pi](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf).
