# PL Club Raytracer Benchmark

This is a port of the PLClub winning entry to the 2000 ICFP
programming contest.  The original program was written in OCaml
and ported to SML was done by Stephen Weeks for the MLton benchmarks.
In this version, the code has been split up into separate files and
some of the OCaml names have been changed to the corresponding SML
names (*e.g.*, `float` replaced by `real`).  The test input is the
chess board scene by Leif Kornstaedt and it is rendered 10 times.
